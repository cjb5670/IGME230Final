# IGME230Final
A collection of games to help you get better at other games


A collection of mini-games designed to hone your skills in larger, more complex games. This web page will consist of 4 pages: a homepage, and 3 simple games. The home page will describe the rules for each game, along with their purpose and links to the games. Navigation will be a menu that is always present on the home screen, but the cursor needs to hover near the top of the webpage to make the menu show up in the game screens.
The games are as follows:

Speedy Accuracy:
	A game designed to assist with first person shooters, where reflex and accuracy is everything. A series of dots will show up on the screen, one at a time, and the player will have a limited time to click on the dots. Recorded near the bottom will be dots hit, dots missed, and shots missed.

Roy-g-biv:
	A game designed to encourage unique and out of the box thinking, a word of a color in a different color than is written will show up on the screen, along with 4 other word/color combinations below it. The player will have to click on the word on the bottom that is the same word as the word on top. Near the bottom, average seconds between words, words correct, and words incorrect will be scored.

Dodge!:
	A game designed to test sense of rhythm, memory, and ability to think ahead, dodge consists of a vehicle moving down a track with 3 lanes. Obstacles will come down the track in 2 of the lanes in regular intervals, but the area right before the actual vehicle will be obscured. Players will have to remember which lanes are clear and which are not. Below the vehicle, a score of successful obstacles passed will be tracked.
