AccuShot!


AccuShot is a simple web game designed to increase your speed, accuracy, and general reflexes in first person shooter games. This web page will consist of 2 pages: a homepage and the AccuShot game proper. The home page will describe the rules for AccuShot, along with its purpose and link to the game. Navigation will be a menu that is always present on the home screen, but the cursor needs to hover near the top of the webpage to make the menu show up in the game screen.

AccuShot proper will consist of circles appearing on the screen at regular intervals that will dissapear either when clicked on, or after a set period of time. The size of the circles, the frequency at which they appear, and the duration they are on screen will all be adjustable by the player by moving the mouse to the bottom left of the screen. 
The game will keep track of how many circles are clicked on, how many times the player has clicked somewhere that wasn't on a circle, and how many circles dissapeared without being clicked on.
