    <h1>About the AccuShot</h1>
    <div id="main">
		<p>The majority of the time spent on making this project was figuring out how to and making the game itself work. I learned that JS works slightly differently when living in an external file as
			opposed to imbeded, and making that work was a bit difficult. 
			<br>
			I also learned a lot more in-depth things about forms, how they handle data, and how JS can edit data. Dynamically clearing areas of a page was also a challenge.
