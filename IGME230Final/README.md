AccuShot!


AccuShot is a simple web game designed to increase your speed, accuracy, and general reflexes in first person shooter games. This web page will consist of 2 pages: a homepage and the AccuShot game proper. The home page will describe the rules for AccuShot, along with its purpose and link to the game. Navigation is a button that brings you to the main game.

AccuShot proper will consist of a menu and a play area. The menu allows you to edit the more exact details of the game, such as the speed at which circles appear, the size of the circles, and the ammount of circles that show up before a game over.
The game will keep track of how many circles are clicked on and how many times the player has clicked somewhere that wasn't on a circle.
